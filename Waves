Take each thread from every strand,
And place them by the weaver's hand.
In ordered rows, let letters rest—
A fabric square, precisely blessed.
But truth lies not in left-to-right,
Nor top-to-bottom's downward flight.
The loom's true secret, weavers know,
Runs corner-wise, from high to low.
Where warp meets weft at angles keen,
The hidden message can be seen.
Follow the bias, thread by thread,
Where neither horizontal nor vertical led.
First letter first, second letter second,
In grid formation, all are reckoned.
Then trace the path where corners meet—
The diagonal makes wisdom complete.
